This is a test for the chatbot to read this and chunk to milvus DB.
A complete and effective prompt typically consists of the following components:

- **System Prompt**
    
    Sets the tone, role, or behavior of the model (e.g., *“You are a helpful real estate broker.”*).
    
- **User Prompt**
    
    The actual task or query provided by the user (e.g., *“Is this house a good deal?”*).
    
- **Examples (Shots)**
    
    Sample input-output pairs that show the model how to perform the task (used in few-shot learning).
    
- **Context**
    
    Any relevant background information or prior messages that help the model interpret the task more accurately.
  
Note: Git commits from user name edulapalle, santosh1001 both are from Santosh Reddy Edulapalle. I just have some problems with git integration.
