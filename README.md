This is a test for the chatbot to read this and chunk to milvus DB.
A complete and effective prompt typically consists of the following components:

- **System Prompt**
    
    Sets the tone, role, or behavior of the model (e.g., *‚ÄúYou are a helpful real estate broker.‚Äù*).
    
- **User Prompt**
    
    The actual task or query provided by the user (e.g., *‚ÄúIs this house a good deal?‚Äù*).
    
- **Examples (Shots)**
    
    Sample input-output pairs that show the model how to perform the task (used in few-shot learning).
    
- **Context**
    
    Any relevant background information or prior messages that help the model interpret the task more accurately.

# Introduction to Applied Machine Learning

Machine learning is the field of computer science that focuses on developing algorithms that can learn from and make decisions based on data. It is a major subfield of artificial intelligence (AI).

## üîç Core Concepts

### 1. Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, algorithms are trained on labeled data. Common supervised models include:

- **Linear Regression**: Predicts numerical values based on linear relationships.
- **Logistic Regression**: Used for binary classification problems.
- **Decision Trees and Random Forests**: Tree-based models used for classification and regression.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Useful for classification tasks with clear margins of separation.

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
Used when data lacks labels. Algorithms identify patterns or structures. Popular techniques include:

- **Clustering (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN)**
- **Dimensionality Reduction (e.g., PCA, t-SNE)**

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
An agent learns to take actions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. It's used in robotics, game AI (e.g., AlphaGo), and recommendation engines.

## üß† Neural Networks

Neural networks are composed of layers of interconnected "neurons." They can model complex, non-linear relationships in data. Deep learning involves neural networks with many hidden layers and is especially effective for:

- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Speech recognition

Famous architectures include:

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** ‚Äì Image processing
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** ‚Äì Sequence modeling
- **Transformers** ‚Äì Powering large language models (LLMs) like GPT and BERT

## üß™ Model Evaluation

Key metrics include:

- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, and F1-score
- ROC AUC
- Confusion Matrix

Cross-validation, grid search, and hyperparameter tuning are essential for improving model performance.

## üßπ Data Preprocessing

- **Handling Missing Data**: Imputation, deletion
- **Normalization & Standardization**
- **One-Hot Encoding**
- **Train-Test Split**

Feature engineering plays a key role in improving model quality.

## ‚öôÔ∏è ML Tools & Frameworks

- **Scikit-learn**: Classical ML models and pipelines
- **XGBoost/LightGBM**: Gradient boosting frameworks
- **TensorFlow and PyTorch**: Deep learning libraries
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Pre-trained NLP models
- **MLflow**: Experiment tracking and model lifecycle

## üåç Real-World Applications

Machine learning powers:

- Personalized recommendations (Netflix, Amazon)
- Fraud detection (credit card companies)
- Self-driving cars (Tesla, Waymo)
- Healthcare diagnostics (medical imaging, genomics)
- Chatbots and virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa, ChatGPT)
