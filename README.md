This is a test for the chatbot to read this and chunk to milvus DB.
A complete and effective prompt typically consists of the following components:

- **System Prompt**
    
    Sets the tone, role, or behavior of the model (e.g., *“You are a helpful real estate broker.”*).
    
- **User Prompt**
    
    The actual task or query provided by the user (e.g., *“Is this house a good deal?”*).
    
- **Examples (Shots)**
    
    Sample input-output pairs that show the model how to perform the task (used in few-shot learning).
    
- **Context**
    
    Any relevant background information or prior messages that help the model interpret the task more accurately.
# Introduction to Applied Machine Learning

Machine learning is the practice of teaching computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed. It is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI), which refers to systems or machines that mimic human intelligence.

There are three main types of machine learning:

1. **Supervised Learning**: The model learns using labeled datasets and makes predictions based on that training.
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: No labels are provided. The model identifies patterns and structures from the data itself.
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.

In applied ML, one commonly used model is a Decision Tree, which splits data based on feature values. Another powerful model is a Neural Network, which mimics how neurons function in the brain.

Key concepts include overfitting, generalization, bias-variance tradeoff, and feature engineering. Datasets are often preprocessed through steps like normalization, encoding, and dimensionality reduction using PCA.

Popular libraries include Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.

This repository serves as a starter guide for students and developers interested in learning applied ML with hands-on examples.
